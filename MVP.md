## Business Project Minimum Viable Product

### Client: 

A construction company (specializing in residential housing) at Austin, Texas starts thier financial planning for the next year.
The manager of the financial department want to know the recent house price around the Austin area as an important factor for estimating the construction budget.


### Question/Need:

Qestion: How can we predict the house price? 

Need: House prices for houses in Austin, Texas and features related, i.e.,house location, bedroom numbers, garage spaces etc. 

### Impactï¼š

When the contruction company get the listing house price, an estimation of the construction cost will be determined. Therefore, the financial department will
have a reliable source for planning budget for construction supply that will not be wasteful or shortage for the projects. 
This solution for evaluating company budget will be more efficient and accurate, which I will discuss in the "alternate Solution Path" Section. 

### Data Description:

I will use a data set from Kaggle about the listing house price in Austin, Texas:
https://www.kaggle.com/ericpierce/austinhousingprices?select=austinHousingData.csv

The data set contains ~10000 rows and ~47 columns.

Unit of Analysis (that will shown in MVP): Regional house price map, .

Characteristics/Features: Living Area, Price source, property tax rate...

### Solution Path:

We want to predict house price in Austin, Texas --> We hypothesis that knowing the listing house price will help us link to the construction cost of the target property--> We will use the construction cost predicted for budget planning next year to precent construction cost waste or shortage.

Alternate Solution Path: To predict the house price in Austin, Texas, if not using the data science method, we can manually collect construction material quantity, transpotation cost, current construction material price, etc. to calculate the potential construction budget. However, this method can be complicated and with no reliable source to validate the calculation.

### Criteria for Success:

Predict the house price within +/-5% of the real listing price. 

### Assumptions and Risks:

Assumptions: House listing price has a stable link (relationship) to the construction cost.
Risks: If the House listing price is not representable to the construction cost, e.g., the recent new COVID variant change the relationship between the construction cost and house listing price, then our analysis will be not that valuable.
### Tools:

I will use Google sheets to perform EDA.
I will use Tableau to create Data visulization plots.
