## Business Project Proposal

Client: 

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system? Who is this work for specifically?
Question/Need:

What is the question behind your analysis? What data science opportunity and potential application do you see? What is the purpose of the EDA you will do and the data science model you will propose?
Impact

What impact are you trying to achieve? In other words, what will your work do for your client
What is your impact hypothesis?
Data Description:

What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
Solution Path

For this project, you need to propose a data science solution path. This is a model that will help you to achieve your desired impact. What is your data science solution path? 
What other solution paths might be viable? How else could you accomplish your goals if not through data science? (Think practically; you might not even need advanced methods. If this is the case, make a justification for why advanced methods are the preferred solution path.)
Criteria for Success

What does success look like? How specifically will you measure your results in order to determine whether your work is successful? Think about the practical goals of your work.
Assumptions and Risks:

Given what you’ve said about your desired impact and the solution(s) you will use to achieve it, what are some assumptions you’re making?
What are the risks to the approach you’ve identified?
Tools:

How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
MVP Goal:

What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
