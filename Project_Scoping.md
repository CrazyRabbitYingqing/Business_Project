## Project Scoping

### Exercise #1: Admissions Team Help

You are a data scientist for a data science bootcamp. 
The admissions team reaches out to you to help decrease the number of applicants who 
drop out of the application process. How would you approach this problem?
  
#### What exactly is the problem you’re hoping to solve?

 Decrease the number of data science bootcamp dropouts.

#### What constitutes a successful project?
  
  Clear analysis procedures and sucsessful validation.
  
#### What data do you plan to explore?
  
  The characteristics of each applicants, e.g., education level, age, current work status, and the reason why they want to attend a data science bootcamp.
  
#### What type of analysis do you plan to try?

  Regression, Classification

#### What potential findings do you hope to discover?

After classify the applicants, find the feature relationship of which feature impacts the classification the most.

#### How will you validate your proposed approach?

Separate the data into several sub data sets and use one of them as the validation set.

#### What does the project timeline look like?
  
 Should have results produce every week. And then discuss with the admission team for model optimization choices.

### Exercise #2: Shipping Company Safety

You are a data scientist for a shipping company.
As a part of a new safety initiative, the executive team would like your help to decrease the number of employee
accidents in warehouses. How would you approach this problem?

#### What exactly is the problem you’re hoping to solve?

Find out the most dangerous accident causation in the warehouse.

#### What constitutes a successful project?

 Clear analysis procedures and sucsessful validation.

#### What data do you plan to explore?

The characteristics of the workers who cause the accident, e.g, age, education level, work time length in the warehouse. Also the cause of the accident is an important feature to collect.

#### What type of analysis do you plan to try?

Regression, classification
#### What potential findings do you hope to discover?

The most popular causation of the accidents or what type of worker is the most prone to cause the accident.

#### How will you validate your proposed approach?

Use extra data sets to validate the model.

#### What does the project timeline look like?

 Should have results produce every week. And then discuss with the ware house worker for model optimization choices.
